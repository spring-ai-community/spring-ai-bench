Spring AI Bench is positioned to evolve from a local benchmarking tool into a comprehensive cloud-based runtime platform for AI agent execution.

== Strategic Vision

=== Three-Tier Value Stack

. **Framework Layer** (Spring AI Agents): Development abstractions and agent integrations
. **Runtime Layer** (Spring AI Bench Cloud): Hosted execution infrastructure with enterprise features
. **Automation Layer** (GitHub Actions): Workflow orchestration and continuous evaluation

== Phase 1: Cloud Runtime Migration

=== Operational Drivers

* **Always-on availability**: Eliminate dependency on personal computers for benchmark execution
* **Scalable execution**: Support concurrent benchmark runs across multiple repositories
* **Resource isolation**: Proper sandboxing without local security concerns
* **Cost efficiency**: Pay-per-use model vs maintaining local infrastructure

=== Technical Implementation

==== Cloud Infrastructure

* **AWS/GCP deployment** with auto-scaling capabilities
* **Container orchestration** using existing DockerSandbox implementations
* **REST API layer** for remote benchmark execution
* **Multi-tenant isolation** for enterprise security

==== Architecture Leverage

* **Spring Cloud Deployer SPI** already integrated (`bench-core/pom.xml`)
* **Sandbox abstraction** designed for this evolution (`LocalSandbox` → `DockerSandbox` → `CloudSandbox`)
* **Distributed execution** foundation already in place

==== API Design

[source,yaml]
----
# Example API endpoints
POST /api/v1/benchmark/run
GET  /api/v1/benchmark/{id}/status
GET  /api/v1/benchmark/{id}/results
POST /api/v1/workspace/create
----

== Phase 2: GitHub Actions Integration

=== Agent-as-a-Service Workflows

==== Issue Labeling Pipeline

[source,yaml]
----
# .github/workflows/agent-labeling.yml
name: AI Agent Issue Labeling
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
jobs:
  label-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: AI Agent Labeling
        uses: spring-ai-bench/agent-action@v1
        with:
          benchmark: 'issue-labeling-v2'
          agent: 'claude-code'
          model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet'
          workspace: ${{ github.workspace }}
          api-key: ${{ secrets.SPRING_AI_BENCH_API_KEY }}
----

==== PR Review Automation

[source,yaml]
----
# .github/workflows/pr-review.yml
name: AI Agent PR Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: AI PR Review
        uses: spring-ai-bench/pr-review-action@v1
        with:
          benchmark: 'pr-review-comprehensive'
          agent: 'claude-code'
          review-depth: 'full'
          include-tests: true
          include-security: true
----

=== Continuous Benchmark Evaluation

==== Real-World Performance Metrics

* **Live agent performance** on actual repositories
* **Benchmark result feedback** loop
* **Performance degradation detection**
* **Agent capability evolution tracking**

==== GitHub Marketplace Strategy

* **Marketplace actions** for common benchmarks (labeling, review, testing)
* **Freemium model** with usage-based pricing
* **Enterprise features** (custom agents, private benchmarks, SLA guarantees)

== Phase 3: Enterprise Platform

=== Multi-Tenant Architecture

==== Security & Isolation

* **Tenant-specific sandboxes** with resource quotas
* **Data isolation** for proprietary codebases
* **Audit logging** for compliance requirements
* **Role-based access control** (RBAC)

==== Custom Benchmark Framework

[source,java]
----
// Enterprise custom benchmark definition
@BenchmarkDefinition
public class CustomCodeReviewBench {

    @AgentSpec(type = "claude-code", model = "claude-3-5-sonnet")
    private AgentConfig reviewer;

    @SuccessCriteria
    private List<ReviewCriteria> criteria;

    @Timeout(minutes = 10)
    public BenchResult execute(PullRequest pr) {
        // Custom enterprise logic
    }
}
----

=== Revenue Model

==== Consumption-Based Pricing

* **Runtime minutes** (following TestContainers Cloud model)
* **API calls** and benchmark executions
* **Storage** for workspace and result data
* **GitHub Actions marketplace** revenue share

==== Tier Structure

* **Free Tier**: Limited runtime minutes, public repositories only
* **Professional**: Increased limits, private repository support
* **Enterprise**: Unlimited usage, custom benchmarks, dedicated support, SLA guarantees

== Technical Foundation Advantages

=== Existing Infrastructure

* **Sandbox implementations** already support local, Docker, and cloud execution
* **Spring Cloud Deployer** provides distributed task orchestration
* **MCP integration** enables rich tool ecosystem
* **GitHub API integration** for repository operations
* **TestContainers support** for container-based isolation

=== Development Timeline

==== Q1: Cloud Foundation

* Deploy Spring AI Bench to cloud infrastructure
* Implement REST API for remote execution
* Add authentication and basic multi-tenancy

==== Q2: GitHub Actions MVP

* Release issue labeling action
* Implement PR review automation
* Create GitHub Marketplace presence

==== Q3: Enterprise Features

* Custom benchmark framework
* Advanced security and compliance
* Enterprise customer onboarding

==== Q4: Scale & Optimize

* Performance optimization
* Cost management features
* Advanced analytics and reporting

== Success Metrics

=== Technical KPIs

* **Benchmark execution time** and reliability
* **API response times** and availability
* **Resource utilization** efficiency
* **Sandbox security** incident rate

=== Business KPIs

* **GitHub Actions adoption** rate
* **Enterprise customer acquisition**
* **Revenue per execution minute**
* **Customer retention** and satisfaction

== Risk Mitigation

=== Technical Risks

* **Scalability challenges**: Leverage Spring Cloud patterns and proven container orchestration
* **Security vulnerabilities**: Implement defense-in-depth with multiple isolation layers
* **Performance bottlenecks**: Use existing Spring AI Bench metrics and monitoring

=== Business Risks

* **Market competition**: Focus on Java/Spring ecosystem advantage and enterprise features
* **Pricing pressure**: Emphasize value through superior Spring integration and reliability
* **Customer acquisition**: Leverage existing Spring community and enterprise relationships

== Conclusion

This roadmap transforms Spring AI Bench from a research tool into production infrastructure that enterprises will pay for. By following the proven TestContainers playbook—framework for development, hosted runtime for production—Spring AI Bench can capture significant value in the emerging AI agent execution market.

The technical foundation is already in place. The market need is clear. The revenue model is validated. The path forward is cloud migration followed by GitHub Actions integration, creating a comprehensive platform for AI agent execution in enterprise Java environments.

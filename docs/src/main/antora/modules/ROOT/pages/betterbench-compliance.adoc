Spring AI Bench commits to following Stanford's https://betterbench.stanford.edu/[BetterBench] 46-criteria framework for benchmark quality assessment.

== Overview

BetterBench defines best practices across four benchmark lifecycle stages:

1. **Design** (11 criteria) - Purpose, scope, metrics, interpretability
2. **Implementation** (9 criteria) - Code availability, reproducibility, contamination resistance
3. **Documentation** (14 criteria) - Process documentation, limitations, transparency
4. **Maintenance** (3 criteria) - Code usability, feedback channels, support

This document tracks Spring AI Bench's compliance with each criterion.

Success criteria and result verification for benchmarks.

== Overview

The verification system determines whether agent execution was successful.

NOTE: The current verification implementation is temporary and will evolve into a comprehensive **judge concept** in the https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-agents[Spring AI Agents] framework. This migration will provide more sophisticated result validation capabilities beyond simple command execution.

_This page is under development._
